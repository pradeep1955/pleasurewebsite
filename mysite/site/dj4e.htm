            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I am a retired electrical engineer who graduated from Government Engineering College Bilaspur in 1978. I joined MPEB in 1979 as a Graduate apprentice. After the state bifurcation in November 2000, our organization was renamed as CSEB and later as CSPTCL under CSEB.

            <p>
                Most of my service period was in the construction and maintenance of transmission lines in Chhattisgarh. I thoroughly enjoyed my work. It was a team effort, and my colleagues and senior officers understood each other and were ready to help out in any difficult time. I retired as Executive Director in 2017.

            <p>
                Since my retirement, I have developed a keen interest in computers and data science. The creation of this site is also a result of my keen interest in this field.
