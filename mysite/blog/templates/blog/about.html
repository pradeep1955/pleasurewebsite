               🌱 Meet Pradeep Chowdhary – A Curious Learner on a Tech Journey 🌱
Once powering high-voltage lines as an electrical engineer, now exploring the invisible lines of code, AI, and IoT, Pradeep is a humble grassroots learner with a spark in his heart and curiosity in his soul.

Retirement didn’t slow him down — it opened a new chapter. Fascinated by the world of data science, Django, and ESP32 gadgets, he’s gently stepping into domains he never imagined in his early career. He learns every day, not to boast, but because it brings him joy — the kind that makes him wonder, “Why didn’t I have this magic back then?”

He dreams of creating something meaningful — maybe a website to help vendors, maybe an IoT device to bring comfort to homes. With a hands-on attitude, he codes, he edits, he builds — often with a question in mind and a smile when it works.

Pradeep may call himself a beginner, but he’s truly a modern-day explorer — one who learns not to chase trends, but to understand the world a little better every day. 🌍💡

                Most of my service period was in the construction and maintenance of transmission lines in Chhattisgarh. I thoroughly enjoyed my work. It was a team effort, and my colleagues and senior officers understood each other and were ready to help out in any difficult time. I retired as Executive Director in 2017.

                Since my retirement, I have developed a keen interest in computers and data science. The creation of this site is also a result of my keen interest in this field.
